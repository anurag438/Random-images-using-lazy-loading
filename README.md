### Description
This web page renders images with photographer names on the page using `LAZY LOADING`.
Lazy loading is an `optimization technique` for waiting to load certain parts of a webpage, especially images, until they are needed.
`Intersection Observer API` is used in the project.

### About the page
This page loads images which are in the view of the user.
When the user scrolls or goes to the end of the page other images are loaded.
And when user reaches the end of the result, next results are automatically loaded which is done by `Intersection Observer API`.
Loading symbol is added which will be visible when data is fetched.
The api used in the project is taken from pixels API and it is a public api.
While doing the project `Light House Dev Tool` is used for increasing the performance of the page.
